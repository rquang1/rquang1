            Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) are persistent and unique
            identifiers for referencing a research resource and are used for
            promoting research resource identification and tracking. Catalog
            numbers change, disappear or can be reused for another resource, but
            RRIDs always resolve to the same research resource and endure beyond
            the existence of the research resource itself. It’s an easy and
            practical method for improving reproducibility, transparency and
            tracking.

            A reliability score is manually set for all genes and indicates the
            level of reliability of the analyzed protein expression pattern
            based on available RNA-seq data, protein/gene characterization data
            and immunohistochemical data from one or several antibodies with
            non-overlapping epitopes. The reliability score is based on the 44
            normal tissues analyzed, and if there is available data from more
            than one antibody, the staining patterns of all antibodies are taken
            into consideration during evaluation.  The reliability score is
            divided into Enhanced, Supported, Approved, or Uncertain.

        Chemicals within the DISQOVER platform, are a diverse set of entities
        that could be used within a chemical library used for lead detection on
        targets. The data model focuses on chemical structures and properties.
        Through the use of the Chemaxon search plugin one can find similar
        chemicals to infer information useful for lead optimization purposes.

        Refers to information collected and analyzed from biological markers
        that indicate normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or
        responses to therapeutic interventions. These markers, often measurable
        substances like proteins, genes, or molecules, are used to assess
        various physiological conditions, disease states, or treatment responses
        in biological systems. Biomarker data is crucial in diagnostics, disease
        monitoring, and developing personalized treatment strategies in
        healthcare.

            Clinical usage of the biomarker, can be one of the following values:
            Diagnostic: A biomarker that can be used to determine which disease
            or condition an individual has, and to differentiate between
            diseases or conditions that may physically appear similar.
            Prognostic: A biomarker that can be used to predict how a known
            disease or condition may progress. Predictive: A biomarker that can
            be used to predict the likelihood of response or lack of response of
            a particular therapy. Exposure: A biomarker, typically a chemical,
            that can be found in response to an individual's consumption of food
            or other contact with these chemicals or their precursors.
            Susceptibility: A biomarker that is associated with an increased, or
            in some cases, decreased chance of developing a disease or medical
            condition in an individual who, from a clinical standpoint, does not
            yet have that disease or medical condition. Monitoring: A biomarker
            measured repeatedly for assessing status of a disease or medical
            condition or for evidence of exposure to (or effect of) a medical
            product or an environmental agent.

            A reliability score is manually set for all genes and indicates the
            level of reliability of the analyzed protein expression pattern
            based on available RNA-seq data, protein/gene characterization data
            and immunohistochemical data from one or several antibodies with
            non-overlapping epitopes. The reliability score is based on the 44
            normal tissues analyzed, and if there is available data from more
            than one antibody, the staining patterns of all antibodies are taken
            into consideration during evaluation.  The reliability score is
            divided into Enhanced, Supported, Approved, or Uncertain.
